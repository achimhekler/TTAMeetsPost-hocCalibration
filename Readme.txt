In the file "PosthocUncertaintyCalibration.ipynb", the proposed method and the considered calibration metrics are implemented. Furthermore, we provide the code for the baseline post-hoc calibration methods.

The file "Evaluation.ipynb" comprises the statistical evaluation of the implemented approaches.

In the folder "TrainValidSplit" the splits of the training and validation data sets for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the skin images are stored. The "valid" column indicates whether the image is contained in the training dataset (valid = 0) or the validation dataset (valid = 1).
